# 03_Greatest_Common_Divisor

### First commit: 
Only trying to grasp / understand the logic and maths behind the Euclidean algorithm.
I tried to write a program for 2 specific numbers, and see myself how it goes down. 




### Future (second, third) commits:
Would like to make it with using while loops, if-else statements and a "def GCD():" function
This way it will look cleaner and will work for any numbers (only whole integer nums) what comes from the input (user) in our case.
